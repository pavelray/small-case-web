Stocks
[Problem Statement]

Develop a pseudo frontend web application for Stock Info.

 

[Ideal Behaviour]

— Create a Dashboard on the UI to keep track of all the relevant stocks, with their real time prices.

— You have to fetch real time stocks data from the third party API provided.

— All the real time individual stock price data also has to be stored in local frontend db with timestamp to calculate progression/regression.

Progression: Demonstrating percentage increase in stock prices over time.

Regression: Demonstrating percentage decrease in stock prices over time.


[Minimum Requirement]

— Create a Dashboard on the UI to keep track of all the relevant stocks, with their real time prices.

— Provide functionality to call stock details by name or ticker(symbol).

— Make an API call and demonstrate details of stocks.

— Zip all your source code, deployment instruction, screenshots and upload them.


[Extra Work]

Along with everything from the above level :

— Implement a live stock price functionality for selected stocks.

— Provide beautiful line graphs demonstrating stocks individual performance and progression/regression.

— Implement functionality to index top performing stocks based on the provided data on the UI.

— Use your imagination and add features which would make things easier for end users.

— Zip all your source code, deployment instruction, screenshots and upload them.

[Bonus/Brownie Points]

1. Use ES6/7 practices .

2. SEO practices, semantic markup.

3. Minified/optimised web build, static build, Good lighthouse score.

5. PWA
